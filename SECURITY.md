# Security policy

ScanAlways is security software, so we hold it to a higher bar than most
projects: a bug here can weaken the machine it is meant to protect.

## Supported versions

ScanAlways is pre-1.0. Only the latest commit on `main` receives security
fixes. Please reproduce on `main` before reporting.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main`  | Yes       |
| Anything older | No |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

Report it privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/notbrianbob/ScanAlways/security/advisories/new)
(the repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**). Include:

- the affected module (or the hub) and the commit you tested,
- what an attacker can do, and what access they need first,
- steps or a proof of concept to reproduce it, and
- any suggested fix.

## What to expect

ScanAlways is maintained by a small team, so these are targets, not guarantees:

- **Acknowledgement** within 7 days.
- **Assessment** (confirmed or not, and a severity) within 14 days.
- **A fix or mitigation** for confirmed high-severity issues as quickly as we
  can, normally within 30 days, followed by a published advisory that credits
  you unless you prefer otherwise.

Please give us a reasonable chance to ship a fix before disclosing publicly.
We will not pursue legal action against good-faith research that follows this
policy, avoids harming other people's data or systems, and does not degrade
service for others.

## What counts as a vulnerability

In scope:

- Anything that lets ScanAlways be used to **weaken** a machine: for example,
  causing it to disable, interfere with, or mislead Microsoft Defender, or to
  modify or delete user files.
- Privilege escalation through the hub when it runs as a Windows service (for
  example, through its configuration, log paths, or file handling).
- Loading or executing code that was not compiled into the hub.
- Resource exhaustion that defeats the documented throttling.

Out of scope:

- The documented limits in each module's README. For example, the decoy
  module detecting nothing is by design, not a vulnerability.
- Malware that does not react to a module's signals. That is a limit of
  deception, not a bug.
- Issues that require an attacker who already has administrator rights on the
  machine.
